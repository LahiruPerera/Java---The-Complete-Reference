-------An Overview of Java--------

Object-Oriented Programming
	-two paradigms:
		process-oriented model: characterizes a program as a series of linear steps (that is, code).
		This can be thought of as code acting on data. problems appear as programs grow larger and 
		more complex.
		
		object-oriented programming:  organizes a program around its data (that is, objects) and
		a set of well-defined interfaces to that data. These programs can be characterized as data
		controlling access to code
		
Abstraction: can hide complexity through abstraction. In Java, we use abstract class and interface
to achieve abstraction. Abstraction can be managed through the use of hierarchical classifications.
For example if we take a car, we think it as a well-defined object. We do not think about individual
parts.
